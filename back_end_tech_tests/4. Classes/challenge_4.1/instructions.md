# 4.1 Create a Stack Class
I'm sure you remember this one from fundamentals... but if you don't, here's your chance to get to recreate it all from scratch!
## Task:
Create a Stack class.

A stack is a way of storing data. It is only open at one end and can only have items added or removed, one at a time, from that end. Like stacking bowls on top of each other.

Your stack will need:
- A push() method,
- A pop() method,
- An isEmpty() method,
- An isFull() method,
- A peek() method,
- A clear() method,
- An autoFill() method
