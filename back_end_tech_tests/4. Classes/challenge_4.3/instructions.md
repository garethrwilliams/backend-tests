# 4.3 Fix the Number Calculator Errors
We had an idea where we would create a class that would help us calculate numbers for us. We would give it a group of numbers and then our calculator would apply its operations we want when we ask it to.

## Task:
These are the things we need you to help us fix.
- The constructor;
    this creates a new array from any collection of numbers entered into the constructor
- The generate() method;
    this adds a new number into the object's array by summing all the numbers together, dividing by the last number and then raising it to the nearest integer
- The getMidpoint() method;
    this returns the midpoint of the object's array
- The getUniqueFactors() method;
    this gives all the unique factors (factors that only appear once for all the numbers) in the object's array
