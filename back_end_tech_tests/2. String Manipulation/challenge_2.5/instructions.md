# Decode the Binary String

Did you know, in JavaScript if you convert a number to a string using ".toString(2)" it will return it in binary form...

It's a shame that there is no given inverse of this, so we're going to create our own.

Decode the message hidden in binary form... You'll need to consider how spaces will work too...

## Task:

Given a string in binary format, decode the message

Each letter will consist of 5 digits of 0's or 1's

e.g. decodeBinary("0100001001110110110100101") -> "hi me"
