# 2.1 Reverse the Capitalisation
I'm sure you've come across this small puzzle... can you take a string and capitalise the first letter of the word.

It's useful if you have a name in a database in lower case and want to give a personalised greeting to your user!

But, let's take this one step further... What if we tried to reverse the capitaliation of every letter in a string. UPPER CASE goes to lower case and vice versa.

## Task:
Create a function that takes a string and reverses each letter into its upper or lower case counterpart.

E.g.

"NorthcODERS" => "nORTHCoders"
