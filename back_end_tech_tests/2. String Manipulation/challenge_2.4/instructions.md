# 2.4 Match the Words that Match the Pattern
It's easy to match a word in a sentence when we know exactly what we're looking for... but what if we don't?

What if we want to match multiple words that share some characteristics but not others?

For example, let's say we wanted to match the words of the format "?a?a?as", where "?" can be any letter, in the string: "I like to eat apples, bananas and papayas"

We should match "bananas" and "papayas"

## Task:
Given a matcher and a string, find all instances of the matcher in the string and return them in an array.

Remember a ? is any letter
