## Codility <a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/">link</a>
A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position a, and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to b. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, d.

## Task:
Create a function that counts the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target. Your function must be efficient and complete its calculation in the specified time limit.
