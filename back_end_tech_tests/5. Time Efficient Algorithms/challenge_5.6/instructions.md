## 5.6 How Many Passes of a Value do we make when Counting to a Number?
Have you come across this question?

For all the numbers between 0 - 100, how many 9's are there?

The right answer is... 20!

Why 20?

9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99

Don't forget 99 has 2 9's!

But what if we wanted to know how many 7's there are counting up to 7,513? Or, 24's there are counting up to 21,846?

### Task:
Create a function that accepts 2 numbers, the first is the upper bound of the counting (e.g. 100) and the other to find all the occurences of a number up to the upper limit (e.g. 9)

E.g. passingNumbers(100, 9) returns 20 as there are 20 occurences of 9 between 0 and 100. 

The return will be the number of occurences of said number between 0 and the upper limit.
