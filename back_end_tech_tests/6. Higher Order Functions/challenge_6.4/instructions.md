# 6.4 Every Once in A While

I'm sure at some point in your Northcoders career, you have utilised the array method every.

It's quite useful when we need it. But this time we want to implement every in a new way... A way that will enable us to test whether the arguments of a function all pass the predicate function, regardless of data type we pass in

## Task:

Implement the every higher order function to work for all data types we pass in

e.g.

const divisibleBy2 = (num) => num % 2 === 0;

const allDivisible = every(divisibleBy2)

allDivisible(2, 3, 4) -> false;
allDivisible([2, 4, 6], {1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6}) -> true
