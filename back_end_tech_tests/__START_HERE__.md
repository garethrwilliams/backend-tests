# Back End Tech Tests!
---

Welcome to the tech test repo!

## Set Up:

This is vital stuff!

First, you are going to need to install all the dependencies that are associated with this repo. 

Make sure that you are in the root directory, then run this script:

```http
npm install
```

This should mean you're ready to go!

## Structure:

---
There are 6 main directories filled with tech tests for you.

### 1. Intermediate Challenges

These are to get you into the groove for the later ones that come. They are what you are most likely to face in a tech test and should leave you scratching your head for a little bit as you get the tests to work.

---

### 2. String Manipulation Challenges

Not everything you do in your coding career will involve the manipulation of numbers! Frequently, it will be to work with strings.

Strings can bring their own challenges when trying to manipulate them and that is why we have a section dedicated to them.

Using Regex's in with string's are a powerful way to work with this data. Try to use Regex's, where possible, to get more comfortable with them... But, at the end of the day, passing the tests in any way still counts!

### 3. Object Manipulation

Working with objects is an essential part of a programmers day to day life. They are highly malleable, allowing us to manipulate the data with ease.

Albeit, some of the challenges we may face in the future may be more complicated than we first think...

Therefore, it is good practice to start challenging ourselves to solve different kinds of problems when faced with an object.

### 4. Class Challenges

Sometimes, you'll be asked to use OOP to solve a problem instead of FP... These are here to help you get back on top of OOP so you can smash through that curveball you might face.

Remember, a lot of critical technologies use OOP principles including, C++, C# and Java. If you're going to an interview for an OOP language heavy firm, you'll probably get an OOP style test.

This will also introduce a couple of new concepts to you... Why? Well, if you meet something unfamiliar in a tech test, you'll be expected to research!

### 5. Time Efficient Algorithms

Delving a bit into Computer Science here. These tests are to get you familiar with an important concept in programming.

Building efficient algorithms.

The way you may first solve a problem might not be scalable, and if you have your eyes set on top companies, knowing how to shrink the time it takes to get an answer is an invalualbe skill.

You aren't left blind though, below are a few links for you to investigate to help you!

### 6. Higher Order Functions

The beauty of higher order functions is that they are extremely versatile... Think of .filter(): we pass in a predicate and it will return an array where only values that pass our predicate test are given to us.

So handy!

But, what if we need to create one for our own purposes?

Good news! That's what these will be kata will be training you on.

---

### 7. Advanced

Are you up for a challenge?

These are 4 functions that should make you utilise all the skills you've used so far. They might seem simple at first, but each one has a little twist that you will need to consider before you can solve it

Inside each Challenge directory will be instructions on the tech test, a test file, a function file and a solution file.

I strongly recommend completing the challenges without looking at the solution. They are there to help you compare your solution against mine and to show you that the tests will pass, if needed.
